%\paragraph{$R_0$ definition}
%
The basic reproductive number, which is generally denoted by $ R_0 $,
is a threshold quantity  we can  
 control with particular strategies. The epidemiological interpretation of 
$ R_0 $ is the average number of secondary cases produced by an infected
individual introduced into a population of susceptible individuals.
Using van den Driessche's \cite{VandenDriessche2017a} definition of reproductive number
we obtain
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eqn:reproductive_number}
    \begin{aligned}
        R_0 :=
        &
        \frac{\kappa}{(\kappa + \mu)(\delta_L + \mu)}
        \left(
            \mu R_1 + \delta_L
        \right)
        \left[
            \frac{p\beta_S}{R_2}
            +\frac{(1 - p) \beta_A}{\gamma_A+\mu}
        \right],
    \\
    \text{where} &
    \\
        R_1 &= 1 - \theta(1 - \epsilon),
    \\
        R_2 &= \mu + \delta_H + \gamma_S + \mu_{I_{S}}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
%
The factor $\frac{p\beta_S}{R_2}$ measures the proportion of new infections
generated by a symptomatic infectious individual in the time that it lasts
infected. In a similar way, the factor $\frac{(1 - p) \beta_A}{\gamma_A+\mu}$
measures the new infections generated by an asymptomatic infectious individual
in the time that it lasts infected. The factor 
$\frac{\mu R_1 + \delta_L}{\delta_L + \mu}$ measures the number
of individuals in lockdown that leave the lockdown, which can be infected.
And finally, the factor $\frac{\kappa}{\kappa + \mu}$ measures
the time of the disease's incubation.
%
If we consider that there is no lockdown, then $ R_0 $ is reduced to
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eqn:reproductive_number_tilde}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tilde{R}_0 :=
        &
        \frac{\kappa}{(\kappa + \mu)}
        \left[
            \frac{p\beta_S}{R_2}
            +\frac{(1 - p) \beta_A}{\gamma_A+\mu}
        \right].
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
%
Note that we have the relation $ R_0 \leq \tilde{R}_0 $. These indicate that there is greater transmission of the disease if there is no lockdown.

Considering Assumptions 2, we can establish a vaccine reproductive number,
in which individuals who have already been vaccinated
can become infected individuals by being in contact with the
symptomatic infected. Using van den Driesscheâ€™s \cite{VandenDriessche2017a}
definition of reproductive number and \cite{Alexander2004}, we obtain

\begin{equation*}
 R_{0}^V := \left[ 1-\frac{\varepsilon \lambda_V}
 {\mu+\lambda_V+\delta_V}
 -\frac{\theta\mu(1-\epsilon)}{\mu+\delta_L+\lambda_V}\right]
 (\mu R_1+\delta_L)R_0.
\end{equation*}
%
The threshold quantity $R_0^V$ is the reproductive number of infection
which can be interpreted as the number of infected people produced
by one infected individual introduced into the population in the
presence of vaccination.

    Contour plot  of $R_0^V$ as a function of vaccine efficacy $( \varepsilon) $ and
    vaccination rate $(\lambda_V)$ and vaccine-induced immunity average time of half year.
    Orange line represents the value of $\lambda_{Vbase}=\num{0.000611}$, corresponding to a
    coverage $x_{coverage} = \num{0.2}$ and a horizon time $T=\num{365}$ days. 
    Intersection of black line and blue line show a scenario in which it is
        possible to have the $R_0^V=0.65$, considering a vaccine efficacy of 
        \num{0.8} and a vaccination rate 
        of \num{0.7}.}
    \label{fig:rvcontour1}
\end{figure*}

\Cref{fig:rvcontour1} shows $R_0^V$ as a function of vaccine efficacy and vaccination rate. 
The blue line, $ \varepsilon = 0.8 $, tells us what value of $ \lambda_V $ we take  to
have the level curve where $ R_0^V<1 $.

\Cref{fig:Nolockdown} shows the region of vaccine efficacy and vaccination rate, 
for which $R_0^V <1$. In this scenario, there is no lockdown effect. Note that when  vaccine
efficacy is less than 0.2, there is no vaccination rate for which $R_0^V <1$.
In the absence of lockdown individuals, there is a region not feasible for vaccine efficacy
and vaccination rate.

\Cref{fig:Lockdown} shows the region for which $R_0^V <1$  when there are lockdown individuals.
In this scenario, we observe that there are values for the vaccine efficacy and vaccination
rate where $R_0^V <1$, which are smaller than the ones we choose in \Cref{fig:Nolockdown}.
